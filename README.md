Simple Pokedex App

Project Objective
To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

1. In this project, I faced the tasks of fetching data from an external Pokemon API, deciding what data to use in my application, using the Bootstrap library to implement styling and modal function, as well as general design choices.

2. I made the decision to rely on the Bootstrap library for modal styling rather than implementing the modal from scratch. Using the library made coding the modal more efficient. One consequence is that I risk the modal not looking mundane and less unique. One design choice I made was to fill in the modal with more information on each Pokemon, and to create a unique Pokemon type background color for all 18 types.

3. I don't think I would do many things differently for this project. If I could do something differently, it would be to use images with a higher resolution for displaying the pokemon. I would also like to find a different font, as it looks a bit thin in the modal. I would also like to implement multiple pages that delve more into each pokemon, or categorize them differently. One final thing I would perhaps do differently is have even more implementations in the pokemon details modal such as its evolution stages.

4. This project taught me not only how to use JavaScript to fetch data from an API, but also how to use the Chrome Debugger to find the specific data I need, as it's often hidden in multiple objects and arrays. I also learned how powerful external libraries such as Bootstrap can be, especially when implementing common website elements such as modals. I had the opportunity to practice more of my JavaScript skills, especially when figuring out how to dig out the specific data point I was looking for from the API, and how to format it properly. One small skill I learned was just how useful the ternary operator can be, especially in the scenario where I had to add a class to each pokemon type that gave it a unique background color. Because of this, I was able to reduce my lines of code from 18 lines down to a single line.

This project uses:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript


I used this website to help with modal design choices, especially type color, font size, pokemon details, and background color.
